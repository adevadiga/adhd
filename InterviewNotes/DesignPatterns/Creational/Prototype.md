Prototype

    In plain words
        Create object based on an existing object through cloning.

    Real world example
        Remember dolly? The sheep that was cloned! Lets not get into the details but the key point here is that it is all about cloning

    In short, it allows you to create a copy of an existing object and modify it to your needs, instead of going through the trouble of creating an object from scratch and setting it up.

    Programmatic Example
        Cloneable in Java

    When to use?
        When an object is required that is similar to existing object or when the creation would be expensive as compared to cloning.
