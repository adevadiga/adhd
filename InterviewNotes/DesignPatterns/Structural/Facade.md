Facade
    In plain words
        Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

    Real world example
        How do you turn on the computer? "Hit the power button" you say! That is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade.

    Wikipedia says 
        A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.

    Programmatic Example
        Taking our computer example from above. Here we have the computer class
        
            class Computer
            {
                public function getElectricShock()
                {
                    echo "Ouch!";
                }

                public function makeSound()
                {
                    echo "Beep beep!";
                }

                public function showLoadingScreen()
                {
                    echo "Loading..";
                }

                public function bam()
                {
                    echo "Ready to be used!";
                }

                public function closeEverything()
                {
                    echo "Bup bup bup buzzzz!";
                }

                public function sooth()
                {
                    echo "Zzzzz";
                }

                public function pullCurrent()
                {
                    echo "Haaah!";
                }
            }

        Here we have the facade
            class ComputerFacade
            {
                protected $computer;

                public function __construct(Computer $computer)
                {
                    $this->computer = $computer;
                }

                public function turnOn()
                {
                    $this->computer->getElectricShock();
                    $this->computer->makeSound();
                    $this->computer->showLoadingScreen();
                    $this->computer->bam();
                }

                public function turnOff()
                {
                    $this->computer->closeEverything();
                    $this->computer->pullCurrent();
                    $this->computer->sooth();
                }
            }

        Now to use the facade
            $computer = new ComputerFacade(new Computer());
            $computer->turnOn(); // Ouch! Beep beep! Loading.. Ready to be used!
            $computer->turnOff(); // Bup bup buzzz! Haah! Zzzzz
