üèÉ Visitor
    In plain words
        Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

    Wikipedia says
        In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.
