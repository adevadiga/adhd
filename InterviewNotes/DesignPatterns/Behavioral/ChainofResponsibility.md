ðŸ”— Chain of Responsibility
        In plain words
            It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

        Wikipedia says
            In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.

        Real world example
            For example, you have three payment methods (A, B and C) setup in your account; each having a different amount in it. A has 100 USD, B has 300 USD and C having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as A then B then C. You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD. Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account A will be checked if it can make the purchase, if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. If not, request will move forward to account B checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler. Here A, B and C are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.

        Programmatic Example

            Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts

                abstract class Account
                {
                    protected $successor;
                    protected $balance;

                    public function setNext(Account $account)
                    {
                        $this->successor = $account;
                    }

                    public function pay(float $amountToPay)
                    {
                        if ($this->canPay($amountToPay)) {
                            echo sprintf('Paid %s using %s' . PHP_EOL, $amountToPay, get_called_class());
                        } elseif ($this->successor) {
                            echo sprintf('Cannot pay using %s. Proceeding ..' . PHP_EOL, get_called_class());
                            $this->successor->pay($amountToPay);
                        } else {
                            throw new Exception('None of the accounts have enough balance');
                        }
                    }

                    public function canPay($amount): bool
                    {
                        return $this->balance >= $amount;
                    }
                }

                class Bank extends Account
                {
                    protected $balance;

                    public function __construct(float $balance)
                    {
                        $this->balance = $balance;
                    }
                }

                class Paypal extends Account
                {
                    protected $balance;

                    public function __construct(float $balance)
                    {
                        $this->balance = $balance;
                    }
                }

                class Bitcoin extends Account
                {
                    protected $balance;

                    public function __construct(float $balance)
                    {
                        $this->balance = $balance;
                    }
                }


        Now let's prepare the chain using the links defined above (i.e. Bank, Paypal, Bitcoin)
            // Let's prepare a chain like below
            //      $bank->$paypal->$bitcoin
            //
            // First priority bank
            //      If bank can't pay then paypal
            //      If paypal can't pay then bit coin

            $bank = new Bank(100);          // Bank with balance 100
            $paypal = new Paypal(200);      // Paypal with balance 200
            $bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300);    // Bitcoin with balance 300

            $bank->setNext($paypal);
            $paypal->setNext($bitcoin);

            // Let's try to pay using the first priority i.e. bank
            $bank->pay(259);

            // Output will be
            // ==============
            // Cannot pay using bank. Proceeding ..
            // Cannot pay using paypal. Proceeding ..:
            // Paid 259 using Bitcoin!
