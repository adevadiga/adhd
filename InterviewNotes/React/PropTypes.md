# Typechecking With PropTypes

As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking.
For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to typecheck your whole application.
But even if you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities.

>For performance reasons, propTypes is only checked in development mode.

```
Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string
};

// Specifies the default values for props:
Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Stranger'
};


class Greeting extends React.Component {
  static defaultProps = {
    name: 'stranger'
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello, {this.props.name}</div>
    )
  }
}
```

> The propTypes typechecking happens after defaultProps are resolved, so typechecking will also apply to the defaultProps.
