# Spread operator (...)

The spread operator (...) looks exactly like the rest operator, but is its opposite:

```
Rest operator: collects the remaining items of an iterable into an Array and is used for rest parameters and destructuring.

Spread operator: turns the items of an iterable into arguments of a function call or into elements of an Array.
```
